## What's Here

* A web-based JavaScript quiz that gives users 60 seconds to answer 10 questions
* Incorrect answers subtract 15 seconds from the game clock
* During the quiz, the user is provided feedback to indicate correct and incorrect answers
* Final score is based on number of questions correct, number of questions incorrect, and a bonus is given if there is time left on the clock when the game finishes
* Users are also given a Rating based on their performance. There are 5 total ratings: Novice, Apprentice, Journeyman, Master, Grandmaster
* When the game finishes, a user has the option to save their score to the high score list (in local storage)
* If they elect to save their high score, their initials, score, and rating will populate the leaderboard
* In the high score list, the Raddymaster is the pinnacle of JavaScript knowledge. He holds the maximum score achieveable in the quiz. His initials, AAA, are a nod to arcade games of the past
* The layout of the web page was built using primarily Bootstrap. There are some in-line styles to override the Bootstrap, but these are minimal
* Test Your Byte is a nod to [Test Your Might](https://testyourmight.com/), a Mortal Combat forum
